# Inversion-Game-
Inversion is a grid-based domination puzzle game that is based on a recurring mini-game I've seen through several video games.

Before the game is played the user is prompted by choosing settings upon startup. What should the size of the grid be and what tile visuals are desired? What it the minimum amount of clicks the user should need to solve the puzzle? Then, once the game begins the user is presented with a randomized grid.

Once the user starts playing, (s)he can click on any of the tiles in the grid to switch the color of that tile and all adjacent tiles to the opposite color. Once they set the entire board to the same color, then they win! The user can use the randomize button in order to restart the grid with the same difficulty as set before, and they can also use the solver button to be presented the answer inside the text box. The answer is shown as a series of O's and X's where the X's are the tiles needed to be clicked once.
